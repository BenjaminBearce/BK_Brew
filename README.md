Kyle Schluns and Ben Bearce's take on essential components of making craft home brew.

How to use:  
1) Database folder contains essential constants and information necessary to design home brew.  
2) MainPanel.R and SidePanel.R are apart of the brew system constants and are for the user to customize. 
3) App folder contains app files; use Control_Center.R to execute app. Once open highlight all code and run.
4) Archive folder contains the old app with out Shiny R as user interface. There may still be useful code in there.
